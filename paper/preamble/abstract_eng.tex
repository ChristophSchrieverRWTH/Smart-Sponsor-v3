The charity sector has been facing falling donations. According to surveys a significant reason for this is the lack of transparency and unintended use of currency. Blockchains can help increase trust due to their immutable transaction history.\\
This paper aims to provide a blockchain-based system that increases trust in donations. Taking a look at how other blockchain-based systems attempt to solve this, a niche is detected.  By attaching conditions to currency it is possible to ascertain the wishes of the donor are fulfilled. This will be done using a tokenised currency. There are conditions the sender of a transaction and the receiver of a transaction need to fulfill. Only if both sides fulfill their conditions a transaction passes, preventing misuse of donations.\\
After creating the prototype called \emph{Smart Sponsor} tests regarding functionality and performance are run to gather data. Evaluating this data shows the feasibility of systems using conditions that ensure the sender and receiver in a transaction are eligible. These systems are slower than normal transactions depending on the number of conditions attached.\\
It is concluded that with further development, the performance can be increased further, allowing a cryptocurrency that can serve normal transactions and ensure important transactions such as donations follow the wishes of the sender.
