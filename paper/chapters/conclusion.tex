\chapter{Conclusion}
In this proposal, we presented the psychological motivations for people donating and factors that caused a trend of declining donations. After looking at how other technologies try to alleviate this problem, common points that have not been addressed are identified to create a new alternative.\\
This project sets a framework to increase trust in the donation process. Blockchain-based systems using programmable money guarantee money can only be spent by the people the donor intended and only for uses the donor intended. By using hashes it is made possible to store private data for verification on the blockchain without privacy concerns.
